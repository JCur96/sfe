Description: Extends the sf package to include some
    useful tools for ecologists. Tools include creation
    of and clipping convex hulls to landmasses, version 
    control of data and calculating percentage overlap 
    between hulls of the same species. Work done as 
    part of a Masters thesis to explore feasibility
    of creating a pipeline for geospatial operations
    on historical records from museum collections. 
    Please note that the datastorr functionality is not avaliable for R version
